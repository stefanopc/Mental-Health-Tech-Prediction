# Mental-Health-Tech-Prediction
## Project Work in Machine Learning

### Dataset and task

The dataset used is OSMI Mental Health in Tech, available on Kaggle, which measures the attitude and frequency towards mental health disorders in the context of tech workplace. This survey was filled by respondents who suffer from mental health disorders in tech companies to see if any factors can affect the employee to get treatment or not.

The task consists in analyzing the data and predicting individualâ€™s mental health treatment based on different features (e.g. age, gender, country and several answers about workers' mental health and work) through the deployment of machine learning models.

### Steps

#### 4) Definition and employment of different models

#### 5) Comparison of the models and conclusions

### Libraries

The notebook uses the following libraries:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- sklearn
